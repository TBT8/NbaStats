### This is a practice repo for reading in and doing some simple processing in java on .csv files
The NbaStats class reads in some NBA stats that were downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats)

The class calculates:
 1. The oldest minutes adjusted team in the data set
 2. The player with the most career made 3 pointers
 3. The player with the most blocks in a single season
